# node-practice-01-fullstack-road

Within this Node.js project, we will explore ways to implement an authentication system using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JSON web tokens (JWT), and embedded JavaScript (EJS) for the frontend. The project aims to understand and implement the necessary steps to create and manage authentication in a Node.js-based environment. We will use Express for server management, MongoDB for data storage, JSON web tokens for authentication security, and EJS for building dynamic views on the frontend. Additionally, Postman will be employed for testing and validation of our APIs. The objective is to efficiently integrate these technologies, including EJS and Postman, to build a robust and secure authentication system within your Node.js application.
